# What I am most proud of in the assignment
Myself and Oran both like the idea we've come up with. It's a fun assignment and the brief we we're given aligns with what we enjoy creating in Unity. I am most proud of our synergy in this project and I feel like myself and Oran can achieve a lot by the time its due.
